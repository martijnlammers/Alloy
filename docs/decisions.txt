Build and testing tool:
    CMake + Ninja:
        Pros:
            - Speed comparable to meson  
            - Higher in popularity
            - C/C++ support
            - Building + unit testing 
            - Open source.
        Con:
            - Vanilla CMake is slow
            - Really nasty syntax :/
        Note: 
            - There is currently no scalability requirement for build 
            tool. But might as well because Ninja at worst keeps the 
            build time the same, and at best makes the compile time 
            infinitely better than standard CMake.
